// Bridge connects a pppd to a Hysteria2 PPP session.
//
// Every PPP frame travels the same way, through PPPDataIO: LCP, authentication
// and user data alike. ppp.dataStreams picks which transport that is -- 0 uses
// QUIC datagrams, giving PPP the unreliable link it was designed for, and N > 0
// uses N reliable QUIC streams for paths where datagrams are unusable. Nothing
// here inspects a frame to make that choice, so the transport does no PPP
// protocol parsing at all.
//
// The frame pumping itself lives in relay, shared with the server side: the
// client's endpoint is its pppd, the server's is either its own pppd or an L2TP
// session to an LNS. Only the endpoint differs.
//
// The Hysteria2 connection is the link. It comes up once, carries one PPP
// session, and when it goes it takes the session with it -- Run returns and the
// caller rebuilds both. There is deliberately no attempt to re-dial underneath a
// live pppd: the server releases the address and kills its pppd the moment the
// connection drops, so a client holding its old PPP state would be using an
// address that has already been reassigned.
//
// PPP events do not reach the link. A Terminate-Request or a renegotiation is
// just another frame; only pppd exiting ends things, and then there is nothing
// left to carry.
//
// When NoSpawn is set no child is spawned; the bridge uses its own stdin/stdout,
// so an external pppd can own the process -- pppd's pty option, as netifd
// protocol handlers use.

//
// In nospawn mode hysteria runs as pppd's pty child, so the only thing netifd
// ever sees is pppd's exit code -- and a hangup looks identical whether the
// password was wrong or the network blinked. netifd would therefore restart the
// interface forever against a credential that can never work, showing a generic
// pppd error. The OpenWrt protocol handler sets this variable and reads the file
// back in its teardown, which is where it can call proto_notify_error with
// something useful and proto_block_restart to stop the loop.

// with one answer, written only for the reasons that are worth acting on. This
// answers "is this particular server connected", which a Multilink bundle has one
// of per link and asks continuously.
//
// It has to come from here because nothing else can answer it. From outside, a
// client whose QUIC handshake is being refused every two seconds is exactly as
// alive as one carrying traffic, and pppd exposes nothing about the transport
// underneath it. The OpenWrt handler points this at a per-slot file and its
// status collector reads it back.
